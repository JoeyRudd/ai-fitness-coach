# Training Intensity: How Hard Should You Push?

Understanding the right intensity for your workouts is crucial for making progress while staying safe and avoiding injury.

## What is RIR (Reps in Reserve)?

RIR means "how many more reps could you do before failure." It's a simple way to measure intensity:

- **0 RIR**: You couldn't do another rep with good form
- **1 RIR**: You could do exactly 1 more rep
- **2 RIR**: You could do 2 more reps
- **3+ RIR**: You could easily do 3 or more reps

## Recommended Intensity for Each Set

**For strength and muscle building:**
- Each set should be performed with high intensity and effort
- Take each set to 0-2 RIR (reps in reserve)
- This means you should feel like you could only do 0-2 more reps
- The last 2-3 reps of each set should feel challenging

## Form vs. Intensity: The Golden Rule

**Proper form always comes first!**
- It is very important to maintain proper form and technique throughout each set
- This ensures maximum stimulus to the target muscle group
- It minimizes risk of injury
- If your form breaks down, the set is over - regardless of RIR

## For Beginners: Start Conservative

When you're new to exercise:
- Start with 3-4 RIR to learn proper form
- Focus on feeling the right muscles working
- Gradually increase intensity as you become more confident
- It's better to do 10 perfect reps than 15 sloppy ones

## How to Apply This

1. **Choose a weight** that allows you to complete your target reps with 1-2 RIR
2. **Focus on form** for the first half of your reps
3. **Push harder** in the last few reps while maintaining good form
4. **Stop the set** if your form starts to break down
5. **Adjust weight** next time if you were too far from your target RIR

Remember: intensity without proper form is just a recipe for injury. Master the movement first, then add the challenge!
