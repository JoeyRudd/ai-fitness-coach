This is one of the first questions everyone asks, and the answer is simpler than you think. The golden rule is that **consistency is far more important than intensity**, especially when you're starting out.

## The Sweet Spot for Beginners

For someone new to a structured fitness routine, a great goal is **2 to 3 times per muscle group per week**.

## Training 2 Times Per Week Per Muscle Group

**Rules for 2x a week frequency:**
- Each muscle group should be hit for 2-4 sets per session
- Example split would be upper/lower 4x per week with 3 rest days
- Another example split would be anterior/posterior 4x per week with 3 rest days
- Each Upper/Lower or Anterior/Posterior block should be separated by at least one rest day

**Sample Upper/Lower Schedule:**
- Monday: Upper body
- Tuesday: Lower body  
- Wednesday: Rest
- Thursday: Upper body
- Friday: Lower body
- Saturday: Rest
- Sunday: Rest

## Training 3 Times Per Week Per Muscle Group

**Rules for 3x a week frequency:**
- Each muscle group should be hit for 1-3 sets per session
- Example split would be full body 3x per week with 4 rest days
- Each session should be separated by at least one rest day

**Sample Full Body Schedule:**
- Monday: Full body
- Tuesday: Rest
- Wednesday: Full body
- Thursday: Rest
- Friday: Full body
- Saturday: Rest
- Sunday: Rest

## The Importance of Rest Days

Rest days are crucial for recovery, as they allow fatigue to dissipate and prevent overtraining. Aim for at least 3-4 rest days per week to ensure optimal recovery and progress.

**What happens during rest:**
- Your muscles repair and grow stronger
- Your nervous system recovers
- Energy stores (glycogen) are replenished
- Risk of injury decreases

## Starting Out: Your First Month

If you're completely new to exercise:
- **Week 1-2**: 2 sessions per week, focus on learning movements
- **Week 3-4**: 3 sessions per week if you feel recovered
- **Month 2+**: Consider the full 2-3x per muscle group frequency

Remember: It's better to be consistent with 2 workouts per week than to burn out trying to do 5!
