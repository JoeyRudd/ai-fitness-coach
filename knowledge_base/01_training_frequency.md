# How Often Should I Work Out?

This is one of the first questions everyone asks, and the answer is simpler than you think. The golden rule is that **consistency is far more important than intensity**, especially when you're starting out.

## The Sweet Spot for Beginners

For someone new to a structured fitness routine, a great goal is **2 to 3 frequency per muscle group per week**.

Rules for 2x a week frequency:
* Each muscle group should be hit for 2-4 sets per session.
* Example split would be upper/lower 4x per week with 3 rest days
* Another example split would be anterior/posterior 4x per week with 3 rest days
* Each Upper/Lower or Anteriror/Posterior block should be sepereated by one at least one rest day

Rules for 3x a week frequency:
* Each muscle group should be hit for 1-3 sets per session.
* Example split would be fullbody 3x per week with 4 rest days
* Each session should be separated by at least one rest day

Rest days are crucial for recovery, as they allow fatigue to dissipate and prevent overtraining. Aim for at least 3-4 rest days per week to ensure optimal recovery and progress.
