**Exercise Intensity**
- Each set should be performed with high Intensity and effort
- Take each set to 0-2 RIR (reps in reserve)
- It is very important to maintain proper form and technique throughout
    each set to ensure maximum stimulus to the target muscle group
    and minimize risk of injury.
