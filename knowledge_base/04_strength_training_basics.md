# Strength Training Basics for Muscle Building

Strength training is the foundation of building muscle and improving your body composition. For beginners, the key is choosing the right exercises and mastering proper form before worrying about heavy weights.

## The Best Beginner Exercises for Each Muscle Group

**Chest**: Flat wide grip chest press - builds overall chest strength and size
**Upper Back**: Chest supported flared elbow row - targets upper back muscles safely
**Lats**: Wide grip lat pulldown - develops back width and pulling strength
**Quads**: Leg extension - isolates quadriceps for focused growth
**Hamstrings**: Seated leg curl - targets hamstrings without stressing lower back
**Quads/Glutes/Adductors**: Leg press - compound movement for lower body development
**Triceps**: Tricep extension - isolates triceps for arm development
**Biceps**: Preacher curl - prevents cheating and focuses on bicep contraction
**Shoulders**: Shoulder press - builds overall shoulder strength and size
**Calves**: Straight leg calf raise - targets calf muscles effectively

## Learning Proper Form: Your First Priority

**Start with video research:**
- Search online for proper exercise execution videos
- Focus on reputable sources like TNF, KeenanRMalloy, Trell, JPG Coaching, and Jeff Nippard
- Watch multiple angles to understand the movement pattern

**Then practice and record:**
- Record yourself performing the exercise
- Compare your execution to the reference videos
- Focus on matching the movement pattern, not just completing reps

## Understanding Muscle Connection vs. Movement

**Don't stress about "feeling the muscle work" initially:**
- As a beginner, it can take time to develop mind-muscle connection
- Focus on proper execution and form first
- The sensation will come naturally as you improve your technique
- Quality movement patterns are more important than immediate muscle sensation

## Progression Strategy for Hypertrophy

**Work in the 7-10 rep range:**
- Start with a weight that allows you to complete 7-10 reps with good form
- When you can complete 10 reps consistently, increase the weight slightly
- Return to 7 reps with the new weight and repeat the process
- This ensures progressive overload while maintaining proper form

**Why this rep range works:**
- 7-10 reps is optimal for muscle growth (hypertrophy)
- Allows enough volume to stimulate muscle growth
- Keeps weight manageable for proper form
- Provides clear progression markers

## Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid

**Don't sacrifice form for weight or reps:**
- Adding weight before mastering form leads to poor movement patterns
- More reps with bad form don't build muscle effectively
- Focus on standardizing your form first

**Why proper form matters for progress:**
- Consistent form allows you to accurately track progress
- You'll know improvements come from increased muscle, not better technique
- Reduces injury risk and ensures proper muscle stimulation
- Sets the foundation for long-term success


Remember: Building muscle is a marathon, not a sprint. Master the movements first, then focus on progressive overload. Your future self will thank you for taking the time to learn proper form!
