Good nutrition is the foundation of any successful fitness journey. Here's what you need to know to fuel your body properly.

## Calorie Goals Based on Your Body Composition

**High body fat (wanting to lose weight)**
- Aim for a 300-500 calorie deficit per day
- This means eating slightly less than your body burns
- Focus on nutrient-dense foods to feel satisfied
- Expect to lose 1-2 pounds per week safely

**Low body fat (wanting to gain muscle)**
- Aim for a 200-300 calorie surplus per day
- This means eating slightly more than your body burns
- Combine with strength training for best results
- Weight gain should be gradual and mostly muscle

**Healthy body fat (maintaining current weight)**
- Eat at maintenance calories
- Focus on body composition changes through exercise
- You can still build muscle and lose fat simultaneously

## Protein: Your Muscle-Building Friend

- Eat 0.8-1g of protein per pound of body weight daily
- Good sources: chicken, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, whey isolate, lean beef
- Spread protein throughout the day for best results
- Don't stress about perfect timing - consistency matters most

## Pre-Workout Nutrition

- Prior to a workout, prioritize carbohydrates for energy
- Good options: banana, oatmeal, toast, or a small snack 30-60 minutes before
- Stay hydrated - drink water throughout the day
- If you're new to exercise, don't overthink this - just avoid exercising on a completely empty stomach

## Simple Daily Guidelines

1. **Eat mostly whole foods**: fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains
2. **Stay hydrated**: aim for clear or light yellow urine
3. **Don't skip meals**: eat regularly to maintain energy
4. **Listen to your body**: eat when hungry, stop when satisfied
5. **Be patient**: nutrition changes take time to show results

Remember: Perfect nutrition isn't required for progress. Focus on making better choices most of the time, and be kind to yourself when you're not perfect!
