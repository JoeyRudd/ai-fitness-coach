# Fitness FAQ (Beginner)

## What is TDEE? (maintenance calories / daily burn)
TDEE is how many calories you burn daily. Use it to set calories for your goal: maintain, cut (deficit), or bulk (surplus).
- Maintenance: eat about your TDEE
- Cut (fat loss): 300–500 calories below TDEE
- Bulk (muscle gain): 200–300 calories above TDEE
- Re-check every 4–6 weeks and adjust based on progress
Common mistakes: cutting too hard, changing calories too often, ignoring protein.

## How much protein should I eat?
Aim for 0.8–1.0 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day (about 1.8–2.2 g/kg). Spread it across meals.
- Good sources: chicken, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, whey isolate, lean beef
- Include protein in 3–4 meals/snacks daily
- Higher protein helps muscle, recovery, and hunger control
Common mistakes: very low protein, only 1 big protein meal, relying on low‑protein snacks.

## How often should I train? (frequency / days per week)
For beginners, 2–3 full‑body days per week works best. Do the SAME workout each session to build familiarity with the movements.
- 2 days/week: Mon/Thu (or similar), same workout
- 3 days/week: Mon/Wed/Fri, same workout
- Keep at least 1 rest day between sessions
Common mistakes: switching exercises every session, advanced splits too early, skipping rest.

## Beginner full‑body routine (same workout each session)
Use simple machine‑based movements and focus on form. Do 1–2 sets of 7–10 reps per exercise. Rest 120–180s between sets.
- Leg press — 1–2×7–10
- Leg extension — 1–2×7–10
- Seated leg curl — 1–2×7–10
- Flat wide grip chest press — 1–2×7–10
- Shoulder press — 1–2×7–10
- Chest supported flared elbow row — 1–2×7–10
- Wide grip lat pulldown — 1–2×7–10
- Preacher curl — 1–2×7–10
- Tricep extension — 1–2×7–10
- Straight leg calf raise — 1–2×7–10
Notes: Add a rep or small weight increase when you hit 10 reps with solid form. Keep the workout identical each session to build familiarity.

## How much cardio for fat loss?
Start with 20–30 minutes of walking most days. Add a bit more only as needed.
- Aim for 6–8k steps/day as a first milestone
- Keep most cardio “conversational”
- Do cardio AFTER lifting on training days
- Combine with a modest calorie deficit
Common mistakes: cardio only, zero strength training, extreme HIIT every day.

## How long should workouts be?
45–75 minutes is ideal. Do cardio after your lifting.
- 5–10 min warm‑up specific to your first lift
- 35–55 min focused lifting (see full‑body routine)
- Optional 10–15 min easy cardio AFTER lifting
Common mistakes: 2‑hour sessions, too many exercises, doing cardio before lifting.

## How should I warm up?
Prime the movement you’re about to do.
- Do 3–5 reps at ~50–60% of your working weight
- Then do 1 rep at ~90% of your working weight
- Wait ~1 minute, then start your working set
Common mistakes: no specific warm‑up for the first lift, 20‑minute random warm‑ups, only static stretching.

## I’m sore—should I train or rest?
Mild soreness is normal when starting out. If soreness continues across weeks, try reducing total set count before changing loads.
- Light movement (walk/cycle) can help
- Keep form strict; don’t chase failure early on
- If soreness persists, remove 1 set per exercise for a week and reassess
Common mistakes: adding volume too quickly, never adjusting sets.

## Cut vs bulk vs maintenance
Pick one based on your goal; keep protein high and training consistent.
- Cut: 300–500 below TDEE, same full‑body workout 2–3×/week
- Bulk: 200–300 above TDEE, focus on progressive overload
- Maintenance: around TDEE, sharpen form and consistency
Common mistakes: switching goals weekly, large deficits/surpluses, random programs.

## Simple meal basics (no strict diet)
Build meals around protein + plants + smart carbs + healthy fats.
- Plate: protein palm‑size, veggies half‑plate, carbs fist‑size, fats thumb‑size
- Drink water with meals
- Keep easy staples: eggs, Greek yogurt, whey isolate, frozen veggies, oats, rice, lean beef/chicken
Common mistakes: all‑or‑nothing rules, long “cleanse” plans, no protein at breakfast.

## Sleep for recovery
Target 7–9 hours. Small habits help a lot.
- Consistent bedtime/wake time
- Dark, cool room; limit screens before bed
- Light snack if hungry; avoid very late heavy meals
Common mistakes: cutting sleep to fit workouts, extra caffeine late day.

## What shoes should I wear?
For lifting, flat/stable shoes. For walking/cardio, comfortable supportive shoes.
- Strength days: flat sneakers or training shoes
- Cardio: shoes that feel comfy for 20–30 min walks
- Avoid squishy running shoes for heavy machine presses
Common mistakes: slippery soles for leg press, worn‑out shoes.
