# Fitness FAQ (Beginner)

## What is TDEE? (maintenance calories / daily burn)
TDEE is how many calories you burn daily. Use it to set calories for your goal: maintain, cut (deficit), or bulk (surplus).
- Maintenance: eat about your TDEE
- Cut (fat loss): 300–500 calories below TDEE
- Bulk (muscle gain): 200 calories above TDEE
- Re-check every 4–6 weeks and adjust based on progress
Common mistakes: cutting too hard, changing calories too often, ignoring protein.

## How much protein should I eat?
Aim for 0.8–1.0 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day (about 1.8–2.2 g/kg). Spread it across meals.
- Good sources: chicken, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, whey isolate, lean beef
- Include protein in 3–4 meals/snacks daily
- Higher protein helps muscle, recovery, and hunger control
Common mistakes: very low protein, only 1 big protein meal, relying on low‑protein snacks.

## How often should I train? (frequency / days per week)
For beginners, 2–3 full‑body days per week works best. Do the SAME workout each session to build familiarity with the movements.
- 2 days/week: Mon/Thu (or similar), same workout
- 3 days/week: Mon/Wed/Fri, same workout
- Keep at least 1 rest day between sessions
Common mistakes: switching exercises every session, advanced splits too early, skipping rest.

## Beginner full‑body routine (same workout each session)
Use simple machine‑based movements and focus on form. Do 1–2 sets of 7–10 reps per exercise. Rest 120–180s between sets.
- Leg press — 1–2×7–10
- Leg extension — 1–2×7–10
- Seated leg curl — 1–2×7–10
- Flat wide grip chest press — 1–2×7–10
- Shoulder press — 1–2×7–10
- Chest supported flared elbow row — 1–2×7–10
- Wide grip lat pulldown — 1–2×7–10
- Preacher curl — 1–2×7–10
- Tricep extension — 1–2×7–10
- Straight leg calf raise — 1–2×7–10
Notes: Add a rep or small weight increase when you hit 10 reps with solid form. Keep the workout identical each session to build familiarity.

## How much cardio for fat loss?
Start with 20–30 minutes of walking most days. Add a bit more only as needed.
- Aim for 6–8k steps/day as a first milestone
- Keep most cardio “conversational”
- Do cardio AFTER lifting on training days
- Combine with a modest calorie deficit
Common mistakes: cardio only, zero strength training, extreme HIIT every day.

## How long should workouts be?
45–75 minutes is ideal. Do cardio after your lifting.
- 5–10 min warm‑up specific to your first lift
- 35–55 min focused lifting (see full‑body routine)
- Optional 10–15 min easy cardio AFTER lifting
Common mistakes: 2‑hour sessions, too many exercises, doing cardio before lifting.

## How should I warm up?
Prime the movement you’re about to do.
- Do 3–5 reps at ~50–60% of your working weight
- Then do 1 rep at ~90% of your working weight
- Wait ~1 minute, then start your working set
Common mistakes: no specific warm‑up for the first lift, 20‑minute random warm‑ups, only static stretching.

## I’m sore—should I train or rest?
Mild soreness is normal when starting out. If soreness continues across weeks, try reducing total set count before changing loads.
- Light movement (walk/cycle) can help
- Keep form strict; don’t chase failure early on
- If soreness persists, remove 1 set per exercise for a week and reassess
Common mistakes: adding volume too quickly, never adjusting sets.

## Cut vs bulk vs maintenance
Pick one based on your goal; keep protein high and training consistent.
- Cut: 300–500 below TDEE, same full‑body workout 2–3×/week
- Bulk: 100–200 above TDEE, focus on progressive overload
- Maintenance: around TDEE, sharpen form and consistency
Common mistakes: switching goals weekly, large deficits/surpluses, random programs.

## Simple meal basics (no strict diet)
Build meals around protein + plants + smart carbs + healthy fats.
- Plate: protein palm‑size, veggies half‑plate, carbs fist‑size, fats thumb‑size
- Drink water with meals
- Keep easy staples: eggs, Greek yogurt, whey isolate, frozen veggies, oats, rice, lean beef/chicken
Common mistakes: all‑or‑nothing rules, long “cleanse” plans, no protein at breakfast.

## Sleep for recovery
Target 7–9 hours. Small habits help a lot.
- Consistent bedtime/wake time
- Dark, cool room; limit screens before bed
- Light snack if hungry; avoid very late heavy meals
Common mistakes: cutting sleep to fit workouts, extra caffeine late day.

## What shoes should I wear?
For lifting, flat/stable shoes. For walking/cardio, comfortable supportive shoes.
- Strength days: flat sneakers or training shoes
- Cardio: shoes that feel comfy for 20–30 min walks
- Avoid squishy running shoes for heavy machine presses
Common mistakes: slippery soles for leg press, worn‑out shoes.

## I'm just starting fitness. What should I do? How should I start as a beginner?
If you're a beginner wondering how to start fitness, here's what you should do. If you're new to structured training, prioritize strength training with light cardio. Strength training preserves muscle mass, supports bone health, and cardio helps keep your heart healthy.
- Start with 2–3 full‑body strength training days per week (Mon/Wed/Fri with rest days)
- Track your progress
- Focus on machine‑based exercises for safety and controlled movement: leg press, chest press, lat pulldown, shoulder press
- Do 1–2 sets of 7–10 reps with proper form—controlled tempo is key
- Allow at least 48 hours between sessions for recovery, especially as a beginner you're more likely to get muscle soreness
- Cardio is optional but reccommended, light walking 2–3 days per week is fine, but strength training should be the priority
- Never skip warm‑ups—3–5 reps at 50–60% working weight, then 1 rep at 90% before your working sets

**For older beginners** (40s, 45, or older): Strength training becomes even more important for muscle preservation and bone health. Follow the same program but allow extra recovery time between sessions.
Common mistakes: starting with cardio-first approach, skipping strength training, rushing recovery, ignoring form for heavier weights.
